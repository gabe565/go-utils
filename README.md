# Utils

A set of Go libraries that I use in various projects.

This package contains reusable utility functions and types that make common tasks easier and help reduce code duplication. Itâ€™s designed to be lightweight and easy to integrate into different projects. Feel free to use it in your own Go programs!

## Installation

To install this package, use:

```shell
